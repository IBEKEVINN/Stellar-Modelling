    "A stellar model is a set of computer programs that calculates the interior structure of a star. It does this by integrating the stellar structure equations to calculate the radius, luminosity, pressure, and temperature across a range of mass points from the centre of a star to its surface. For a star with a given mass and composition there is one unique solution for these equations.\n",

    "We will now integrate the stellar structure equations outward from the centre and inward from the surface. The goal is for the two integrations to meet at $m = \\frac{2}{3}M_{tot}$, though this probably won't be the case using our initial estimates. Here we will calculate the offsets between the integrations at the meeting point. These can then be used in Part 4 to improve our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do these integrations, we will use scipy.integrate.odeint. It can integrate all four stellar structure equations at once (what we will do here), or you can choose to integrate them separately. As input, we will need our initial conditions ($R_s$, $L_s$, $P_c$, and $T_c$), our function from Part 2 that returns the gradients we want to integrate ($\\frac{\\partial R}{\\partial m}$, $\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial m}$, $\\frac{\\partial P}{\\partial m}$, and $\\frac{\\partial T}{\\partial m}$), and a set of mass points at which we want values for $R$, $L$, $P$, and $T$ to be calculated (in this case from $m$ to $\\frac{2}{3}M_{tot}$, or from $M_{tot}$ to $\\frac{2}{3}M_{tot}$). We will have the integrations run one extra step past the meeting point (for reasons that will become clear in Part 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the outward integration we will set the mass step size to be $(\\frac{2}{3}M_{tot} - m)/10^4$. For the inward integration we need to add a bit more complexity. The gradients in $T$ and $R$ are very steep at the outside edge of the star (i.e. at the surface), so we need to use very small integration steps at first. We can then make these steps larger (to cut down on computation) once we get a small distance into the star. Here we will divide the outermost $0.01\\%$ of the mass into $10^4$ steps, and the remaining inward integration into $10^4$ steps. Note that this may require some adjustment for different models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write a program that takes the initial estimates as inputs, calculates initial centre and surface values and derivatives for $R$, $L$, $P$, and $T$ using our earlier functions, chooses step sizes, and runs our two integrations. The program will also have the option to plot figures showing the values of $R$, $L$, $P$, and $T$ at all mass points, and will return an array of the offsets between the integrations at the meeting point."

    "The final step in making our stellar model will call upon the functions we have already written to set up the initial values and carry out the integrations from the centre and surface of the star to the meeting point at $\\frac{2}{3}M_{tot}$. We will add a new section that uses the results of these integrations and the calculated offsets between them to adjust the initial conditions. The program will iterate through this process until the integrations meet to within an appropriate tolerance.\n",

We do this by changing each of the four initial estimates ($R_s$, $L_s$, $P_c$, and $T_c$) by a small amount ($1\\%$ is a good change), one at a time. We then run the integrations to the meeting point and see how much the mismatches change. For example, by re-running the integration with ($1.01 \\times R_s$, $L_s$, $P_c$, and $T_c$) as the inputs, we can calulate $\\frac{\\partial\\Delta R}{\\partial R_s}$ as $\\frac{\\Delta R(\\text{new integration}) - \\Delta R(\\text{original integration})}{0.01\\times R_s}$.
